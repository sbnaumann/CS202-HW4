Martin 17: 
    A) 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121 
    B) 1000 0000 = -128 && 0011 = 3  --> -128 + 3 = -125 
    C) -128 + 25 = -103

Martin 22: 
    A) 6 + 3 --> 0110 + 0011 = 1001 : This has signed overflow but not unsigned overflow 
    B) 3 - 2 --> 0011 + 1110 = 0001 : This does not have signed or unsigned overflow but you do push a one off the end 
    C) -5 + -6 --> 1011 + 1010 = 0101 : This has signed and unsigned overflow 
    D) -1 + -6 --> 1111 + 1010 = 1001 : This has unsigned overflow, but not signed overflow
    E) 1 + -5 --> 0001 + 1011 = 1100 : This has neither signed or unsigned overflow 

Martin 24: 
    A) -1 * 21/16 * 1/4 = -21/64
    B) 1 * 19/16 * 1 = 19/16 
    C) -1 * 29/16 * 1/2 = -29/32
